# Find 3 objects around the room and create variables from it,
variable1 = "clock"
variable2 = "boxes"
variable3 = "chairs"
# Insert those variables into an f-string sentence(look at slide 22)in repl.it
fstring = f"There is a {variable1}, {variable2}, and {variable3} in the room."

# Familiarize yourself with the syntax of the print() function.
# Print your name.
print("Juana")
# Print today's date.
print("11-4-25")
# Print the name of your favorite movie.
print("Ice Age")
# Print your name and age on separate lines using a single print() function.
print()
# Use f-strings to print a message like: "In 10 years, [Your Name] will be [Your Age + 10] years old."
name = "Juana"

#syntax is the way we write code
# print("Hello World")
# name = "John"
#in other languages, this is different
# in javascript for example, you define
#variables with let or const or var
#in python, you just give your variables a
#name and then define it with a value

# find a summary of the movie blue beetle online and create a 
# variable called blue_beetle_summary and print it it out to the screen

# print the length of the summary
# upper case the entire summary
# print the summary in lowercase
# replace the word blue with red
# print the summary
# string index the word beetle and print it out
# print the last word of the summary
# print the summary in reverse

##########################input practice#############################################
#input is when we ask the user for input/data
# Ask the user to enter their name.
name = (input("What is your name?"))

# Input Practice #1
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# What are you learning today?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).
q1 = (input("What are you learning today?"))
print(f"Today you are learning{q1}")

# Input Practice #2
# Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:
# Where are you from?
# Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).
q2 = (input("Where are you from?"))
print(f"You are from {q2}")

# Input Practice #3
# Write Python code that displays the user's full name on the screen, by allowing them to enter their first and last name with the following instructions:
# What is your name?
# What is your surname?
# The code must be able to print the user's first and last name on the screen, separated by a space.
q3 = (input("What is your name?"))
q4 = (input("What is your surname?"))
print (f"Your name is {q3} and your surname is {q4} ")

# Exercise:
# Write a program that asks the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a message using both pieces of information
q5 = (input("What is your full name?"))
q6 = (input("What is your favorite color?"))
print(f"Your full name is {q5} and your favorite color is {q6}")
